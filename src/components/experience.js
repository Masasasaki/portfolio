                        <b>Containerizing Microsoft SQL databases</b>
                        <br /><br />
                        I improved the portability and accessibility of company databases 
                        by creating an automated dockerization process for Microsoft SQL databases.
                        <br /><br />
                        Before: Developers had to spend about an hour to set up SQL servers 
                        and manually deploy the databases using pipelines.
                        <br /><br />
                        After: Developers can easily spin up and tear down the docker image of the SQL databases in a couple of minutes   
                        by running a single docker command on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). 
                        The database will always be up to date since I created a pipeline that automatically 
                        builds an image of the databases whenever there is a change in the dev or master branch of the SQL projects.
                    </p>
                    <p className="innersection">
                        <b>Better development experience for SQL databases</b>
                        <br /><br />
                        I enhanced the code quality of databases by generating static analysis reports
                        and developing re-runnable automated build, promote, and deploy pipelines
                        using <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/products/redgate-deploy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redgate Deploy</a> and custom PowerShell cmdlets. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Before: Database developers and administrators did not have any analytical reports to use for reference 
                        or a smooth automated process for building, promoting, and deploying the SQL project.
                        <br /><br />
                        After: Static analysis reports are generated whenever a deployment is made that pinpoints exactly 
                        what changes were made to the database and suggests best coding conventions based on the deployment. The entire 
                        build, promote, and deploy process is automated for a smooth user experience, reducing unnecessary complexity and 
                        frusturation for the developers.

                        <b>Automated creation of a sandbox environment</b>
                        <br /><br />
                        I boosted the efficiency of acceptance testing and analysis by implementing
                        an automated weekly creation of a fully configured sandbox environment containing 
                        2 Microsoft SQL databases, a MongoDB cluster, a RabbitMQ instance, 4 .NET applications on Kubernetes, and 3 virtual machines on the cloud.
                        <br /><br />
                        Before: Engineers, product managers, and business analysts had to spend hours juggling through 
                        each of the components and ensure that the environment was all reset and ready to use.
                        <br /><br />
                        After: Every Monday, a freshly built environment is ready to use with all the latest changes, 
                        saving time and reducing complexity for everyone.
